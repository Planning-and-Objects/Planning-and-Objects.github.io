<p>I got out to the land in September 2020 for the first time by studying satellite images and google maps. I had done some concept art before arrival, and had a vague idea of what I wanted to make, but the dream had to be matched with reality For the first week I walked around exploring, thinking about the site. The property that I bought is at a crossroads in a locally-famous valley, known for the large stone tower that a man with similar ideas as me built some time (I was told) in the 1970s. I find this comforting; it reminds me that I'm not alone.<br>

Soon, a friend joined me, and we got to work on the house â€“ which meant gathering a <b>lot</b> of rocks.<br>
The process of doing this lead to a series of complimentary structural experiments, into <a href="https://Planning-and-Objects.github.io/pages/tents">TENTS</a>.</p>
