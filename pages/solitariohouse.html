	<p>The Solitario House is a perpetually unfinished stone and brick shelter on the edge of a collapsed volcanic dome, 15 miles from the Rio Grande.<br> There is no nearby water, and the closest town, Terlingua, is an hour and a half away by a rugged, single track dirt road.<br><br>Construction in this extreme environment requires that would-be builders come prepared: capable offroad vehicles with tools for field repair,<br> fuel-water-food planning, and careful attention to weight loading are all not simply "musts" to be checked off a list, but essential to survival.<br><br>Plants in the desert are slow growing, dense, and often armored for protection. <br>Solitario House was grown similarly; designed to exist wholly as a part of the environment.<br><br>Designed for thermal regulation, the mostly-dry-stacked stone footing is 3'6" wide at its base, stands 4'6" tall, and measures 70' in perimeter length.<br> It took several people over six weeks of effort to gather and stack all these rocks,<br><br>but it is very satisfying to have built something that will exist for as long as the hills.<br>and the arduous process and conditions lead to numerous inventions.
