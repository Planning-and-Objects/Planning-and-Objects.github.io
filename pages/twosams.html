<h1>TWO SAMS BAR</h1>
<br><p>In December 2020, after most of a year apart from my friends and months in the Chihuhuan desert working on the <a href="https://Planning-and-Objects.github.io/pages/solitariohouse">Solitario House</a> I wanted to have a Holiday Party.<br><br>

However, this was several months before Covid-19 vaccines became available, so, per the thinking of the time, I needed to create an outdoor environment with a lot of ventilation. My apartment didn’t have a yard – but it did offer a steep fire ladder with access to the roof. The challenge of creating a structure that would be hidden but large enough for a party, light enough to get up the ladder, and warm enough so that it could actually be briefly habited in a New York winter was an exciting opportunity to share with my friends some of the rapid-deployment tent technology that I had developed in Texas.
<br><br>
For two nights, a small and varied troupe of people scrambled up to the roof, and had a wonderful time. The third day, certain authorities became aware of the shelter, and it had to be taken down. 
<br><br>
Not everyone was able to come to the Holiday Party before it closed. Fortunately, some friends with a garden-level apartment offered their back lot, and a slightly modified version of the Holiday Party structure was installed.
<br><br>
Operating with a mandatory RSVP system, Two Sams Bar was open for a limited run of nights – and completely booked the whole time. Working with a group of friends to create low-cost drinks and a vegan tasting menu, we covered all our expenses, and created a successful micro-business.

As an artist and designer, Two Sams has been incredibly satisfying to work on – architecture for a party.</p>
